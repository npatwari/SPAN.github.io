      Neal Patwari and Syed Ayaz Mahmud presented a day-long tutorial as part of Mobile and Wireless Week 2019, a week-long tutorial on the POWDER-RENEW wireless research platform in Salt Lake City, Utah.  The tutorial covered using GNU Radio to transmit and receive over the air RF signals on the deployed software defined radios.  Currently, base stations and fixed endpoints are <a href="https://powderwireless.net/area">deployed across the University of Utah campus</a>.  Researchers can apply for an account and then log into compute nodes and run experiments over the air.  In one exercise, attendees made path loss measurements and plotted them vs. distance.  Tutorial instructions and videos will be posted soon.

      Riku Jäntti returns to the SPAN Lab on 13 May 2019.  He will present a seminar on 'Localization in 5G Ultra–Dense Networks', 3-4 pm on Monday May 13, in Brauer Hall, Room 12.  He is is a Full Professor of Communications Engineering and the head of the department of Communications and Networking at Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland. He received his M.Sc (with distinction) in Electrical Engineering in 1997 and D.Sc (with distinction) in Automation and Systems Technology in 2001, both from Helsinki University of Technology (TKK). Prior to joining Aalto (formerly known as TKK) in August 2006, he was professor pro tem at the Department of Computer Science, University of Vaasa. Prof. Jäntti is a senior member of IEEE and associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology. He was also IEEE VTS Distinguished Lecturer (Class 2016). The research interests of Prof. Jäntti include radio resource control and optimization for machine type communications, Cloud-based Radio Access Networks, spectrum and co-existence management, and quantum communications.  Prof. Jäntti's talk has the following abstract: Cellular systems are undergoing a transformation towards the fifth generation (5G). Envisioned applications in 5G include intelligent transport system (ITS), autonomous vehicles and robots as part of future roads, factories and society. These applications rely to a great extent on accurate and timely location information of connected devices. This talk proposes a practical scheme for acquiring precise and timely position information by means of a user–centric ultra–dense network (UDN) architecture based on an edge cloud. The considered solution consists of estimating and tracking the azimuth angle–of–arrival (AoA) of the line–of–sight (LoS)–path between a device and multiple transmission–reception points (TRPs), each having a uniform linear antenna array (ULA). AoA estimates from multiple TRPs are fused into position estimates at the edge cloud to obtain timely position information. Extensive measurements have been carried out using a proof–of–concept software–defined–radio (SDR) testbed in order to experimentally assess the achievable positioning accuracy of the proposed architecture. A realistic UDN deployment scenario has been considered in which TRPs consist of antenna arrays mounted on lamp posts. Our results show that practical UDNs can provide sub–meter positioning accuracy of mobile users by employing ULAs with at least four antennas per TRP as well as by taking into account the non–idealities of the ULAs’ phase and magnitude response.

Non UofU students can participate by sending an email to Neal and request enrollment.  The course is Tue and Thu 12:25 - 1:45pm (MT).  This course meets via <a href="https://spanlab.my.webex.com/join/neal.patwari">web conference<a>: <a href="https://spanlab.my.webex.com/join/neal.patwari">https://spanlab.my.webex.com/join/neal.patwari</a>.  You will need a computer and headset to join the web conference.  This course presents the state-of-the-art in using commercial wireless devices to make radio frequency (RF) channel measurements and sense the state of the environment. RF sensing is used to locate and track people in the vicinity of the RF sensors, to monitor their breathing and pulse rate, to perform gesture and activity recognition, and other applications.  These are often called "device free" sensing because the person being monitored does not carry any device on them, instead, we sense the changes from static deployed wireless network.  This course presents the fundamentals, the statistical models, and the algorithms used in RF sensing.  Students will borrow RF sensors for the semester and implement algorithms that run in real time on the data from their sensors.  We will discuss the most recent research papers in the area via web conference.  Students will implement and improve RF sensing algorithms and be graded in part on their accuracy.  Students will also complete and present a course project to implement or analyze a RF sensing system.

      The SPAN lab has been working as part of an interdisciplinary team across campus on the "Pediatric Research Using Integrated Sensor Monitoring" project funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering to develop new sensor networking tools for epidemiologists.  Over the past two and a half years, we've been developing networking software, air quality sensors, and tools that aid in deployment, monitoring, and visualization, for the specific needs of epidemilogists who want to put sensors in study participants' homes to better know their exposure to air pollution and other asthma triggers.  The end goal is to allow people to reduce their exposure to pollutants that might affect their long-term or immediate health.  Philip Lundrigan, a PhD student at the U, has authored a paper that will be presented at the IEEE International Workshop on Practical Issues in Building Sensor Network Applications (SenseApp 2018) on 1 Oct. 2018, which discusses the EpiFi system of which he has led the development.

He received his M.Sc (with distinction) in Electrical Engineering in 1997 and D.Sc (with distinction) in Automation and Systems Technology in 2001, both from Helsinki University of Technology (TKK).

The research interests of Prof. Jäntti include radio resource control  and optimization for machine type communications, Cloud based Radio Access Networks,  spectrum and co-existence management, quantum communictions and RF Inference.  Riku Jäntti's talk has the following abstract: Low power wireless communications has been identified as one of the key enabling technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT).  The performance of the contemporary IoT connectivity solutions are mainly limited by congestion, interference, and limited operation time with battery. These limitations hampers the scaling of the IoT deployments. The first part of the talk discuss Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity solution that combines existing and emerging wireless communication systems, with a new layer of ultra-low-power or passive ambient backscatter communications (AmBC). An AmBC deice modulates the ambient signal impinging at its antenna. In contrast to traditional systems, AmBC devices do not need a power-hungry transceiver and can achieve up to 1000 times lower power consumption  and 10 to 100 times lower device cost than contemporary active-transceiver-based solutions. The second part of talk, discuss the possibility of using quantum radar technology to improve the performance of backscatter communications beyond the limits of classical systems. The proposed quantum backscatter system utilizes microwave quantum illumination to improve the receiver performance. The communication device, the backscatter tag, is still a classical one. All the complexity is put on the transceiver side.
