  url: "https://github.com/npatwari/rti"
  description: "This data set (in the basement directory) was collected in Fall 2016 for Neal Patwari's ECE 6960 Applications of Fading Channels course as Exam 2.  It provides ground truth coordinates as Neal walked through the basement of his house in a piecewise linear path.  The experiment for this exam was conducted in an approximately 8 meter by 8 meter section in his home. The sensors are placed inside the home. There were 10 sensors operating on 8 channels. The sensors are at the typical power outlet height.  The accompanying code shows how to calculate the true coordinate of the person at any given time using the ground-truth files that are also included in the directory."

  description: "This data set is an extensive set of RSS Data in a house during device-free localization experiements conducted repeatedly, focusing on the changes in the RSS measurements and thus DFL performance after normal changes in the house.  Five sets of experiments were performed. Each set includes results from several experiments, where data was gathered while the subject moved from one location to the next. Over the course of the experiments, objects were moved or altered in the house to determine the effect on the location accuracy of the fingerprint-based method.  In the paper, the data is used to show the rate of performance degradation in fingerprint-based DFL."
