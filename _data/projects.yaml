    We are working with the Powder team to develop, build, and deploy the world's largest open wireless research platform.  Powder (the Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven Experimental Research) is a facility for experimenting on the future of wireless networking in a city-scale “living laboratory”.  Powder is run by the University of Utah in partnership with Salt Lake City, the Utah Education and Telehealth Network, Rice University, and the SPAN Lab at WUSTL. Powder will deploy state-of-the-art software-defined radios around the campus and downtown areas of Salt Lake City, including SDRs on towers, on campus busses, on city vehicles, and more. We will have backpacks of wireless sensors that can be mobile.  All of these devices will be remotely programmable, and assigned to researchers who use the platform.  Researchers can implement future wireless technologies and test them on the Powder platform to quantify their performance in the real world.  We will be developing software to make this as easy as possible, and developing calibration procedures to ensure that the results are as repeatable as possible.

    Software defined radio (SDR) is emerging as a key technology to satisfy rapidly increasing data rate demands on the nation's mobile wireless networks while ensuring coexistence with other spectrum users. When SDRs are in the hands and pockets of average people, it will be easy for a selfish user to alter his device to transmit and receive data on unauthorized spectrum, or ignore priority rules, making the network less reliable for many other users. Further, malware could cause an SDR to exhibit illegal spectrum use without the user's awareness.  The mechanisms used currently (e.g. by the FCC) for locating spectrum offenders are time consuming, human-intensive, and expensive. A violator's illegal spectrum use can be too temporary or too mobile to be detected and located using existing processes. This project envisions a future where a crowdsourced and networked fleet of spectrum sensors deployed in homes, community and office buildings, on vehicles, and in cell phones will detect, identify, and locate illegal use of the spectrum across a wide areas and frequency bands. This project will investigate and test new privacy-preserving crowdsourcing methods to detect and locate spectrum offenders. New tools to quickly find offenders will discourage users from illegal SDR activity, and enable recovery from spectrum-offending malware. In short, these tools will ensure the efficient, reliable, and fair use of the spectrum for network operators, government and scientific purposes, and wireless users.  However, one challenge is that, to preserve privacy, crowdsourced spectrum measurements must not decode the transmitted data. Another is that the sensing strategy must  adapt to the density of traffic and to focus on suspicious activity.  Next, the sensing strategy must stay within an energy budget, have incentive models to encourage participation, and yet have sufficient spatial and temporal coverage to provide high statistical confidence in detecting illegal activity.  Our project will address these challenges and provide an extensive set of experimental data useful for evaluating crowdsourced spectrum monitoring systems.

    This project aims to develop a smart helmet that measures when and where a collision is going to occur, and just prior to (200 ms before) impact, takes action to reduce the injury to the brain of the impact.  Our part of the project is to develop the collision sensing subsystem.   We are investigating two approaches, one that uses a helmet-mounted millimeter-wave monostatic radar to track objects in the vicinity of a helmet, and another that uses ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers in each helmet which then calculate the range between themselves and nearby helmets.  We are developing measurement-based models for the measurement errors that occur in each approach and evaluating their bandwidth, energy, and latency tradeoffs.  UWB is currently strongly limited by channel availability. We have developed new approaches which perform UWB ranging but using less than half as much use of the UWB channel as state-of-the-art approaches, thus allowing more UWB devices to be located, and those measurements to be performed more frequently.

  description: >
    By transmitting radio waves, wireless networks open up a new type of privacy and security threat, which we call the radio window attack. An attacker outside of the exterior walls of a building or secure area can estimate where people are located, what activities they are engaged in, and even what keys are being typed on a keyboard, by listening to the received signals at receivers around the area.  Non-metal walls are mostly transparent to radio waves, like windows for light waves, thus an attacker may ``look inside'' through the radio windows.  We described this attack first in a WiSec 2014 paper.  In this project, we are developing statistical models for the measurements, quantifying the ability of the attacker, and developing novel methods for standard wireless devices to prevent attackers from obtaining information.  Our prevention methods primarily involve proactive changes to the manner in which devices transmit to obscure the human activity and location information available to an attacker.

    This project is part of an Informatics center awarded through the NIH NIBIB project called Pediatric Research Using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS).  The goal of our project is to develop systems for smart and healthly homes, including in-home and personal sensors and actuators made to monitor the exposure of residents, to reduce exposures to pollutants, and improve health.  A key use case is for pediatric asthma patients. Our systems monitor a variety of potential triggers, and in combination with symptom survey results, identify those which lead to asthma exacerbation for the particular patient, and reduce a patient's exposure to them.  Our part of the project is to build an architecture for reliable, long-term sensor network deployments in homes in ways that can be configured at a high level for a variety of research studies using a variety of sensing, actuation, data feedback, data visualization, and patient survey mechanisms.  We are also interested in reversing the top-down view of human subjects research and allowing people to design and conduct repeated measurement randomized controlled trials on themselves, utilizing our software platform and new internet-of-things sensors and actuators.
