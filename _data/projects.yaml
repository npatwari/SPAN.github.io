    We are investigating two ways in which engineering intersects with inequity.  First, we are using systems engineering tools to model the feedback inherent in systemic inequity.  This work tries to address the question, Why have inequities persisted for so long, despite years of activism, education, policy changes, and society’s stated values of equity and non-discrimination?  Our approach is to model the feedback that makes inequity persist, as well as the collective impact of activism and policy changes, using feedback models from systems theory.  Second, we are investigating the discriminatory impact of pulse oximeter differences as a function of race.  Our work hopes to have impact in the design of the next studies of pulse oximetry bias or improved pulse ox designs to make them racially equitable.  To do this, we are studying the statistical distribution of pulse oximeter errors, from a large set of measured ICU data.

    We are working with the POWDER team to develop, build, and deploy the world's largest open wireless research platform.  POWDER (the Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven Experimental Research) is a facility for experimenting on the future of wireless networking in a city-scale “living laboratory”.  POWDER is run by the University of Utah in partnership with Salt Lake City, the Utah Education and Telehealth Network, Rice University, and the SPAN Lab at WUSTL. POWDER has state-of-the-art software-defined radios (SDRs) deployed around the university campus, including SDRs on towers, on campus busses, on city vehicles, and more. All of these devices are remotely programmable and can be assigned to researchers who use the platform.  Researchers can implement future wireless technologies and test them on the POWDER platform to quantify their performance in the real world.  We are developing software to make this as easy as possible, and developing calibration procedures to ensure that the results are as repeatable as possible.  We are also investigating the development of "national radio dynamic zones" on POWDER, that is, areas in which standard FCC rules are loosened and replaced by prediction and measurement to ensure non-interference with others outside of the zone.

    This project aims to develop a smart helmet that measures when and where a collision is going to occur, and just prior to (200 ms before) impact, takes action to reduce the injury to the brain of the impact.  Our part of the project is to develop the collision sensing subsystem.   We are investigating two approaches, one that uses a helmet-mounted millimeter-wave monostatic radar to track objects in the vicinity of a helmet, and another that uses ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers in each helmet which then calculate the range between themselves and nearby helmets.  We are developing measurement-based models for the measurement errors that occur in each approach and evaluating their bandwidth, energy, and latency tradeoffs.  UWB is currently strongly limited by channel availability. We have developed new approaches which perform UWB ranging but using less than half as much use of the UWB channel as state-of-the-art approaches, thus allowing more UWB devices to be located, and those measurements to be performed more frequently.
