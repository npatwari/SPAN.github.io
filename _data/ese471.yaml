      The first lecture of my semester presents the syllabus and gives a big-picture look at the topics covered in the course, how they lead from one to another, to eventually get to the learning outcomes of the course.  These outcomes are to be able to design a transmitter and receiver, and to use link budget analysis and information theoretic tools to design a communication system to meet the specifications given.  No videos have yet been created for this first lecture.

      This lecture presents the most critical concepts needed to study how signals are used to send information in digital communication systems: power, energy, and orthogonality.  The last property requires some motivation, so I describe how orthogonality can be seen as the receiver's ability to separate one signal from another.  I do some examples of orthogonality.

      This lecture applies the concept of orthogonality to describe how a digital communication transmitter and receiver work. Specifically at the transmitter: how they use K orthogonal waveforms; how they send one of M possible linear combinations of those waveforms; and how that choice of one of the M conveys bits in a message.  At the receiver, the fact that the waveforms are orthogonal to each other allows it to separate them and compute the amounts of each waveform sent, and thus guess which of the M possible linear combinations was sent, which indicates which bits were meant to be sent.

      In this lecture I introduce pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and show what the signal looks like in the time domain at the transmitter. I then talk about the matched filter at the receiver and show that it can be looked at as a filter (a convolution) or as an integral of the signal multiplied by the waveform (correlation).  Finally, to keep one symbol from contributing interference to subsequent symbols (inter-symbol interference), we can use the Nyquist Filtering Theorem to describe how to design a pulse shape, starting in the frequency domain.  I describe this with a scissors and paper craft activity.

      In this lecture, I introduce quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), its basis functions and some example constellation diagrams, including for phase shift keying (PSK) and amplitude PSK (APSK).  We then show how to calculate the average bit energy and average symbol energy.  Finally, we introduce complex baseband notation as an equivalent way to represent the two orthogonal basis functions.

      This lecture shows what a PAM and QAM digital communication signal looks like in the time domain, in particular when using a square root raised cosine (SRRC) pulse shape.  Complex baseband notation is used.  The property of 'envelope' is introduced, and offset-QPSK is introduced to show how a short time delay between in-phase and quadrature components can make the envelope relatively constant over time.  Finally, we introduce two versions of M-ary FSK, coherent and non-coherent, and derive the frequency offset between carriers needed for each type of receiver.

      This lecture has two segments.  First, I describe frequency division multiplexing (FDM), in particular orthogonal FDM (OFDM).  OFDM uses a set of orthogonal waveforms in combination, and I explain how it is like a combination of QAM and M-ary FSK.  I show how the transmitted signal can be computed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  In the second segment, I introduce some of the probability tools that you need to be able to evaluate the probability of bit error of particular communications modulations.  One pre-req of the course is an undergrad probability course, so I do an example to refresh your memory of how to use probability density functions and probability mass functions to compute probabilities.

      This lecture covers Bayesian detection theory.  First, we cover the Bayesian minimum probability of error goal, and use it to derive a general expression for the detection test (algorithm) to decide which out of two symbols were sent.  The rule generally applies to when the noise is any distribution.  We then get specific to the case when the distributions are Gaussian.  I derive formulas for the general additive uncorrelated Gaussian noise case, and talk about the effect of different probabilities of two different symbols. Finally I provide the formula for the specific case in which the symbols are equally probable.

      This lecture is all about noise.  In particular, thermal noise, which is added in to every receiving antenna.  The videos explain, from information about the physics of thermal noise, how we can show that our symbols samples (after the matched filter) will contain additive, uncorrelated, and Gaussian noise.  I explain also how to calculate the power (variance) of the noise that contributes to the received signal.

      This lecture derives the optimal decision rule for M-ary, K-dimensional constellations, showing that the rule is, for equally-probable symbols, to pick the symbol vector closest to the measured vector.  Any single decision boundary for this rule is a line, the perpendicular bisector of the line segment between the two symbol vectors, which is proven in the 2nd video.  In combination across all symbols, the decision regions become a Voronoi diagram.

      This lecture covers link budgets, in particular how to design a wireless link to achieve constraints on probability of bit error, bandwidth, bit rate, transmit power, and other parameters.  Sometimes we don't know whether designing from the probability of bit error constraint will result in a bandwidth that is too high, or vice versa.  So we sometimes have to solve from both directions in order to achieve both constraints.  I show the spreadsheet I use for link budget calculations.

     This lecture covers how multipath fading causes the signal to be low in amplitude some of the time as a result of the fat that the antenna adds a random complex value for each multipath component. One way to be robust is to put in a lot of leeway in your link budget.  Other ways involve using multiple antennas at the receiver, at the transmitter, or at both TX and RX.  The latter video covers examples of these three methods.
