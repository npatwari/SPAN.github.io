#  description: >
#    Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) estimates an image map of where people are in an area based solely on the changes that the people's bodies cause to radio waves in the area.  RTI uses transceivers that transmit and measure received signal strength to measure these radio wave changes.  However, RTI needs a high density of transceivers in the environment.  Recently our research showed that we can accurately estimate the speed at which someone crosses a link line based on the measured changes.  This project is to update RTI algorithms to include speed information, which we believe will result in RTI algorithms that are accurate even with low densities of transceivers.

- title: Modeling Inequity as a Feedback System
  description: >
    This project develops tools for analyzing automated decision systems (ADS) which make decisions about what resources people are allocated.  Such systems are deployed in a society which already contains inequities and operate in feedback loops in which the outputs of a decision system then impact its future inputs. We note that algorithms which impact the allocation of resources among people are indistinguishable from “policies”, in fact many government and corporate policies are described as algorithms to lend them more credibility.  Thus algorithms can be judged to either promote and sustain equity, or to promote inequity, as advocated by Kendi for the antiracist / racist case.  In order to analyze policies and ADS, we need to be able to predict how the system will operate in situ in society.  Students in this project will model the sum effect of society with a feedback system, and model its predictive ability on temporal data sets.

- title: Outdoor RSSI data mining
  description: >
    Our lab has developed considerable expertise in environmental monitoring (localization, breathing and pulse rate monitoring) using RF measurements.  We are now deploying tens of remotely accessible software-defined radios (SDRs) on towers and building tops in Salt Lake City, Utah.  These can be controlled from anywhere and used to emulate current or next-generation wireless protocols.  This project is to model the radio channel measurements for the purpose of predicting future values.  The model may include current and past RX power, as well as rain, wind, humidity and temperature.  Radio channel measurements might include signal strength, Doppler, and/or channel impulse response. These measurements will change over time as the environment changes, for example, when the weather changes.  This project is to characterise what kinds of changes are observed as a function of weather, and perhaps other environmental variables.

- title: Privacy-preserving transmitter source localization
  description:  >
    This project is in support of our NRDZ projecct, which will enable future <a href="https://www.doncio.navy.mil/CHIPS/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=10299">national radio dynamic zones</a> (NRDZs).  These NRDZs could enable more dynamic spectrum assignment in particular geographical areas, and spur faster implementation of new wireless technologies and services.  The overall project will develop technologies to enable such zones with monitoring, measurement, and modeling systems which ensure that the new spectrum use in the NRDZ doesn't interfere with other systems outside of the NRDZ.  This project will develop privacy-preserving means for the system to accurately learn about a transmitter (its location, transmit power, antenna pattern) so that the system can quantify the interference it offers to systems outside of the NRDZ.

#- title: Experimental comparison of long range IoT wireless standards
#  description: >
#    There is a current explosion of wireless protocols designed specifically for the use in Internet-of-things (IoT) systems.  These are long-range compared to Wi-Fi, and also lower in data rate.  The goals of these wireless protocols are to connect sensors and actuators to the internet, so that they can make systems "smarter", but to consume very little power, even when sending data to a distant base station.  Popular long-range low rate protocols include LTE-M1, LoRa, IEEE 802.11ah, NB-IoT, SigFox, and Weightless-P.  This project would be to implement one or more of these protocols on a software-defined radio (SDR) and to test performance experimentally.

#- title: Extending a PiCar with ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radar
#  description: >
#    This project will extend a PiCar's sensing capabilities using impulse radar.  A network of PiCars, each with this sensor, can know their relative locations, thus share information about the map of the environment, and move in coordinated ways together without collision.  This project will use a custom UWB-IR platform already developed in our lab and connect it to the Raspberry Pi (that also controls the PiCar).

#- title: Breathing monitoring under rubble
#  description: >
#    In this project, we want to experimentally test the ability to detect a breathing person trapped underneath a collapsed building, for use in search and rescue operations after an earthquake.  We have developed a RF-based breathing monitoring system which uses a 900 MHz CW signal to detect breathing without contact.  The system monitors for the changes in the radio channel caused by changes in a person's chest caused by breathing.  Our device can be operated at lower frequencies, for example, down to 169 MHz.  The lower frequencies experience less attenuation due to concrete and other building materials. This project will be to develop the system to be best able to detect and monitor breathing rate when a person is located in rubble.  Success will likely require modifying the system for low frequency operation (169 MHz), including the development of through-wall directive antennas at this frequency.  Experimental evaluation could be done using concrete walls, or traveling to a <a href="https://www.fsi.illinois.edu/content/courses/programs/special%20ops/structural.cfm">search and rescue training site</a>.

#- title: Efficient smart air filtering for forced-air HVAC systems
#  image: images/PRISMS_home_icon.png
#  description: >
#    Air pollution shorten lives.  Since we spend most of our time indoors, keeping our indoor air clean is one practical action we can take to reduce exposure to air pollutants.  If your home has a forced-air HVAC system, you can install a good filter and run the fan all day (24/7) to clean your home's air.  However, the fan uses significant energy, perhaps $30-60 per month in electricity.  We've shown, using a particulate matter (PM) sensor and a smart thermostat, that turning on the fan only when the PM is high can clean the air almost as well as 24/7 operation, using only a fraction of the extra fan energy compared to 24/7 operation.  In this project, you will explore alternative, smarter, algorithms to control the thermostat and fan together to clean the air, in hopes of achieving even greater efficiency.  This project has a potential to have real impact for future smart home systems.

# hack RSS in some wireless device and perform surveillance of audio from that.  Essentially show that RSS surveillance attack can happen on some IOT devices.
#- title: Audio eavesdropping attack via IoT RSS measurements
#  image: images/harrypotter_light.png
#  description: >
#    Recent research has shown that high rate received signal strength measurements can be used to record audio in the vicinity of a transmitter and receiver.  The mechanism is that sound vibrates surfaces, like walls and tables; the vibration then changes the phase of radio waves which interact with these surfaces; and finally the signal strength is affected by the phases of the waves which arrive at the receiver.  We have demonstrated this effect using software-defined radios recording RSS while the Harry Potter theme song plays on a speaker on a table in between the transmitter and receiver.  This project will use standard IoT devices to demonstrate this attack.

# Use IMU data to improve FACT algorithm
#- title: Using inertial measurement data to improve prediction of collisions
#  description: >
#    This project will develop a new algorithm to predict that two objects will soon collide based on measurements of ranges between many objects in the area and the inertial measurements of these objects.  Alemayehu Solomon Abrar's dissertation developed the Friend-based Autonomous Collision Prediction and Tracking (FACT) algorithm and showed that it works well when the velocity is constant.  This project will extend this algorithm to include accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer measurements, commonly measured with an inertial measurement unit (IMU).  The project will use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCnZ9njfjPU">a team of robots, as we have in past research</a>, to collect measurements to test the new algorithm.
