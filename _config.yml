  The Sensing, People, and Networks (SPAN) Lab at the <a
  href="https://www.wustl.edu">Washington University in St. Louis</a>  
  investigates automated sensing and decision systems, and in particular, 
  how they interact with people. We have a history of using the radio frequency 
  interface of wireless devices to sense human activity and health, and improve 
  the reliability and privacy of wireless networks.  We also investigate how 
  sensing and other "big data" systems and algorithms used on people can have 
  both positive and negative effects on equity in society. Our research is at 
  the intersection of wireless networking, statistical signal processing, and 
  power and inequality. The combination of these tools enables us to study the 
  interaction of people, networks, and sensing systems in new ways that will 
  lead to greater privacy, reliability, and equity of engineered systems.
