<h4> Consent Information Sheet</h4>
<div class="info">
<p>We invite you to participate in a research study being conducted by investigators from Washington University in St. Louis.  We are studying double-blind review for computer science and engineering conferences.  In particular, we are working to understand and quantify the benefits of the double-blind review system.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to participate, you may skip all of the questions and the demographic survey if you prefer.</p>

<p>Your reviews will NOT be used for future research studies or shared with other researchers for their studies, even if we remove identifiers.</p>

<p>Approximately 28 people will take part in this study at Washington University.</p>
